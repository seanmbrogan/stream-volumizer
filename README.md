this is a simple peice of software (that took 3 hours how to figure out how to upload lfs files) that allows different volumes to be set for different "shows" on Airtime Pro broadcast. while your playing games or studying.

for example you could have commercial breaks set to 0 volume.

the scale for volume is 0-1

this should work with any airtime pro station.

by default, this is setup for https://www.radiosidewinder.com/. as this was the inspiration for making this.

this software is still heavily in beta. i mainly got the functional stuff down. just gatta add a way to actually 
add stuff lol.

# Installation

1.simply download zip <br>
2.and extract. then run the stream-volumizer.exe.

if the exe is 1kb or doesnt work. right click on "download zip" and do "save link as". then step 2


# INFO
if you want to change or add your own. goto and edit 'resources/app/config.json'


# Side Stuff i plan todo
